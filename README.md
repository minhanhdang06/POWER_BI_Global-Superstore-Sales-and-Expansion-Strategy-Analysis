## IV. Insight & Recommendation

### Market Expansion

1. **Market Overview**: The company has established presence in all major global markets. Rather than entering a completely new market, it is recommended to expand within the existing market. Canada market is recommended.

Despite its strong Year-over-Year (YoY) growth rate and profit margin, Canada’s customer base remains limited, resulting in lower revenue.

-> It is proposed to develop a strategy to reach a broader customer segment in Canada.

1. **Sales Agent**: Nicole Hansen is currently responsible for the Canadian market. The revenue, profit margin, and YoY growth rate indicators are performing well. It is advisable to continue his/her oversight of this market.
2. **Product Strategy**: Phone, Copiers, Chairs, Bookcases are the company’s best-selling product overall. It is suggested that copiers and phone be positioned as a strategic product for the company.

### Current Market Optimization

- **APAC Market**: Maintain the current strategy for this market as this market has been the best performer overall. Continue to invest heavily in APAC, focusing on high-performing categories like Technology and Furniture (each generating over 1.3M in revenue). Slightly improve the return rate (currently around 6–7%) to boost profit margin further.
- **The EU market** generates ~3M in revenue with a 10–13% profit margin and strong ~55% YoY growth. Focus on expanding Technology and Office Supplies, while maintaining product quality as return rates are stable (6–6.8%).
- **US Market**: Focus on increasing revenue, as the US market shows excellent profitability. Consider expanding product offerings or ramping up marketing efforts.
- **LATAM Market**: Invest cautiously: LATAM has strong growth but low margins.
- **Ineffective Markets:** Africa and EMEA are underperforming, with high customer numbers but negative total profits.

-> It is recommended to investigate the causes behind these issues to develop appropriate strategies for either improvement or withdrawal from these markets.

**Product Performance:**

- Tables have shown poor performance with negative profit margins over the past four years, resulting in losses with each sale --> Discontinue this product or adjust its pricing.
- The return rate for Canon Copier has reached 20% --> Investigate the causes behind this high return rate and implement corrective measures.
