## IV. Insight & Recommendation

### Market Expansion

1. **Market Overview**: The company has established presence in all major global markets. Rather than entering a completely new market, it is recommended to expand within the exisng market. Canada
market is recommended.
Despite its strong Year-over-Year (YoY) growth rate and profit margin, Canada’s customer base remains limited, resulng in lower revenue.
--> It is proposed to develop a strategy to reach a broader customer segment in Canada.
2. **Sales Agent**: Nicole Hansen is currently responsible for the Canadian market. The revenue, profit margin, and YoY growth rate indicators are performing well. It is advisable to connue his/her oversight
of this market.
3. **Product Strategy**: Phone, Copiers, Chairs, Bookcases are the company’s best-selling product overall. It is suggested that copiers and phone be posioned as a strategic product for the company.

### Current Market Optimization

- **APAC Market**: Maintain the current strategy for this market as this market has been the best performer overall. Continue to invest heavily in APAC, focusing on high-performing categories
like Technology and Furniture (each generating over 1.3M in revenue). Slightly improve the return rate (currently around 6–7%) to boost profit margin further.
- The **EU market** generates ~3M in revenue with a 10–13% profit margin and strong ~55% YoY growth. Focus on expanding Technology and Office Supplies, while maintaining product
quality as return rates are stable (6–6.8%).
- **US Market**: Focus on increasing revenue, as the US market shows excellent profitability. Consider expanding product offerings or ramping up marketing efforts.
- **LATAM Market**: Invest cautiously: LATAM has strong growth but low margins. Focus on cost control and increasing AOV (Average Order Value) to improve profitability.
- **Ineffecve Markets**: Africa and EMEA are underperforming, with high customer numbers but negave total profits.
--> It is recommended to invesgate the causes behind these issues to develop appropriate strategies for either improvement or withdrawal from these markets.
- **Product Performance:**
1. Tables have shown poor performance with negave profit margins over the past four years, resulng in losses with each sale --> Disconnue this product or adjust its pricing.
2. The return rate for Canon Copier has reached 20% --> Invesgate the causes behind this high return rate and implement correcve measures.
